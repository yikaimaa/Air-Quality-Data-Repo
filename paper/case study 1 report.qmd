## Context

This analysis was conducted for the Ontario Ministry of Education, specifically the Policy Analytics and Student Well-Being Division. The division is responsible for issuing guidance to school boards during environmental health events, including extreme air-quality episodes. The Director overseeing this work requires an assessment of whether predictive analytics can materially improve institutional preparedness, reduce operational disruption, and protect vulnerable student populations.

Over the past several decades, regulatory advances and improved monitoring have substantially reduced air pollution in many high-income countries [@who2021air]. However, since approximately 2015, climate-driven factors—most notably increasingly severe and frequent wildfires—have emerged as major drivers of extreme particulate exposure [@reid2016wildfire]. In Canada, wildfire smoke has repeatedly affected major population centres, including the Greater Toronto Area and Ottawa–Gatineau. Children are particularly vulnerable to particulate exposure due to developing respiratory systems and higher inhalation rates [@brook2010particulate].

Current school-level responses are largely reactive. Same-day advisories leave limited time for transportation planning, ventilation adjustments, communication with families, and scheduling changes. The central question addressed in this report is whether next-day PM2.5 concentrations can be forecasted with sufficient reliability to support proactive and equitable decision-making.

## Executive Summary

Using 2020–2024 regional PM2.5, weather, and traffic data, we evaluated next-day forecasting models under strict chronological validation. A region-wise LASSO baseline achieved mean out-of-sample $R^2 \approx 0.25$. A sequence-based LSTM improved performance to $R^2 = 0.356$, MAE = 1.96 µg/m³, and RMSE = 2.71 µg/m³. This represents a 12–19% reduction in error relative to persistence baselines.

The forecasting improvement is statistically credible and operationally meaningful. Most importantly, gains are strongest during elevated pollution periods, which are precisely when advance notice is most valuable.

## Data {#sec-data}

### Data Sources and Unit of Analysis

This study constructs a region-level panel dataset for Ontario to support next-day (24-hour mean) PM$_{2.5}$ forecasting. All data are publicly available and obtained from official provincial and federal sources.

Hourly PM$_{2.5}$ measurements were obtained from the Air Quality Ontario historical monitoring program operated by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) [@airqualityontario]. Meteorological data were retrieved from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) weather station observations [@eccc_historical_climate].

The unit of analysis is the **region-day**. All station-level data were aligned temporally at the daily level and spatially aggregated to Ontario administrative regions using official station metadata and a Station ID–to–region lookup table. The resulting dataset contains 51,830 region-day observations spanning 26 regions.

All region-day PM$_{2.5}$ observations were retained during integration. If meteorological data were unavailable for a given region-day, weather variables were recorded as missing rather than dropping the observation. This design avoids systematically excluding high-pollution days during data merging.


### Data Cleaning and Quality Control

#### Weather Data

The Ontario daily weather dataset (2020–2025) was cleaned into an analysis-ready station–day table using a reproducible pipeline. Cleaning steps included:

1. Standardizing column names to lowercase snake_case.
2. Resolving duplicate column names (retaining the final occurrence).
3. Normalizing identifiers (trimming station names and standardizing climate IDs).
4. Parsing timestamps and reconstructing date components.
5. Coercing meteorological variables to numeric types with invalid entries set to missing.
6. Converting gust direction from tens-of-degrees to degrees and normalizing to [0, 360).
7. Engineering quality indicators from metadata flags.

Physical plausibility bounds were applied to detect outliers, which were set to missing and flagged via dedicated indicator variables. Trace precipitation values were set to 0.0 while preserving a trace indicator. Records were deduplicated by (station_id, date), enforcing one row per station per day. A station-level missingness summary was constructed to assess completeness and support screening decisions.

#### PM$_{2.5}$ Processing

Hourly PM$_{2.5}$ observations were aggregated to daily averages at the station level. Days with entirely missing hourly readings were recorded as missing rather than imputed to preserve data integrity. Station-level daily averages were then aggregated to region-level daily means, ensuring consistent geographic granularity between meteorological and pollution datasets while retaining regional heterogeneity.


### Statistical Properties of the Panel

Daily regional PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations exhibit strong right-skewness (skewness $\approx$ 13.85), with rare extreme events exceeding 400 µg/m³. The mean concentration is 6.63 µg/m³ and the median 5.43 µg/m³, indicating that exposure risk is driven by episodic spikes rather than typical days.

Temporal diagnostics reveal substantial persistence. The lag-1 autocorrelation is approximately 0.72, and current PM$_{2.5}$ is moderately correlated with next-day PM$_{2.5}$ (r $\approx$ 0.57). An Augmented Dickey–Fuller test rejects the unit-root hypothesis (p < 0.001), suggesting stationarity in deviations around a stable mean.

Meteorological associations are directionally consistent with atmospheric theory: wind speed and precipitation are negatively associated with PM$_{2.5}$, while temperature exhibits a positive association. These relationships support inclusion of lagged, rolling, and meteorological predictors in forecasting models.


### Visual Evidence of Temporal and Regional Structure

Figure @fig-trend presents the province-wide daily average PM$_{2.5}$ concentration from 2020 to 2024. The time series shows relatively stable baseline levels interrupted by episodic extreme spikes. The most prominent surge occurs in mid-2023, corresponding to large-scale wildfire events that affected Ontario and much of eastern Canada. Outside of these episodes, daily concentrations fluctuate within a narrower range, visually reinforcing the heavy-tailed distribution and strong short-term persistence documented in summary statistics.

Figure @fig-region-mean displays mean PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations by region. Clear cross-regional heterogeneity is evident. Southern and industrialized regions—including the City of Windsor (Essex County), Hamilton, Toronto, Waterloo, and Middlesex—exhibit systematically higher average concentrations than northern districts such as Rainy River and the District of Parry Sound. These differences likely reflect variation in urban density, transportation corridors, industrial activity, and exposure to cross-border pollution flows.

Together, these visualizations confirm two central empirical features of the dataset:  
(1) pollution risk is characterized by infrequent but high-impact spikes, and  
(2) baseline exposure differs structurally across regions.

These properties motivate time-aware forecasting models capable of capturing both temporal persistence and regional heterogeneity.

### Feature Engineering and Leakage Control

All predictors were constructed using strictly historical information within each region to prevent data leakage. Engineered features include:

- Lagged PM$_{2.5}$ values  
- Rolling means and volatility measures  
- Lagged and aggregated meteorological variables  
- Cyclical seasonal encodings (sine/cosine transformations)

Observations lacking sufficient historical information were removed to maintain temporal consistency. All train–test splits were performed chronologically to ensure that evaluation reflects genuine out-of-sample forecasting performance.




## Model {#sec-model}

### LASSO Baseline

A region-wise LASSO regression was implemented as a transparent linear baseline. Separate models were estimated for each region to account for spatial heterogeneity.

Predictors were standardized within a scikit-learn pipeline to ensure scaling parameters were learned exclusively from the training data. A strict chronological split (80% train / 20% test) was applied within each region.

The regularization parameter was selected via five-fold cross-validation on the training set. The L1 penalty induces sparsity, enabling automatic feature selection and improving interpretability.

Evaluation metrics computed on the held-out test set include:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- $R^2$
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- Symmetric MAPE (sMAPE)
- Pearson correlation


### LSTM Sequence Model

To capture nonlinear dynamics and temporal dependence, we implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model using fixed-length 14-day historical windows.

The dataset contains sequences of shape $N \times 14 \times 18$. Samples were time-split (80% train / 20% test) using end_date to prevent leakage. Within the training block, the final 10% was reserved for validation and early stopping.

Model architecture:
- 2-layer LSTM encoder (hidden size = 128)
- Dropout = 0.15
- MLP regression head

Training:
- AdamW optimizer (lr = 1e-3, weight_decay = 1e-4)
- Batch size = 256
- Max epochs = 50
- Gradient clipping = 1.0
- Early stopping (patience = 8)
- Huber (SmoothL1) loss

The target was log-transformed during training and inverted at inference. All metrics are reported in original µg/m³ scale.

Two baseline comparators were evaluated on the same test split:
1. Persistence (tomorrow = last observed value)
2. Rolling mean (tomorrow = mean over window)


## Results {#sec-results}

### LASSO Performance

Across 26 regions, the region-wise LASSO baseline achieved:

- Mean test $R^2$ = 0.25 (median ≈ 0.22)  
- Mean RMSE = 2.9 µg/m³  
- Mean MAE = 2.2 µg/m³  
- Mean Pearson $r$ = 0.55  

Performance heterogeneity was substantial. Some regions achieved $R^2 > 0.45$, while others fell below 0.10, reflecting differences in pollution volatility, wildfire exposure, and structural urban dynamics.

The model selected approximately 30–40 predictors per region on average. Frequently retained variables included lagged PM$_{2.5}$, wind-related metrics, precipitation, and seasonal encodings. While the model provides interpretability and captures linear persistence and seasonal effects, it explains only a modest portion of next-day variability.

### LSTM Performance

The sequence-based LSTM substantially outperformed all baselines on the held-out test set:

| Model         | MAE | RMSE | $R^2$ | Pearson $r$ |
|---------------|------|------|-------|-------------|
| **LSTM**      | 1.96 | 2.71 | 0.356 | 0.598 |
| Persistence   | 2.24 | —    | 0.137 | — |
| Window Mean   | 2.42 | —    | 0.090 | — |

Relative to persistence, the LSTM reduced MAE by approximately 12–13% and improved $R^2$ by more than 0.22 absolute points. Compared to the rolling mean baseline, MAE reduction was approximately 19%. 

Percentage-based metrics (MAPE ≈ 50%) are inflated due to small denominators on low-pollution days; therefore, MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$ provide more stable performance assessments.

Extending the input window from 7 to 14 days yielded only modest gains, indicating that predictive signal is concentrated in recent observations, consistent with short-term accumulation and dispersion dynamics.

### Mechanism and Feature Contribution 

Permutation importance clarifies the mechanism underlying the LSTM’s gains. Recent PM$_{2.5}$ history is the dominant predictor: shuffling the regional daily PM$_{2.5}$ average increased MAE by 0.55 µg/m³, more than double the impact of any meteorological variable. 

Among exogenous predictors, maximum and minimum temperature, wind-related measures (gust speed and direction), and precipitation variables provide meaningful secondary contributions. Long-term calendar indicators and static spatial coordinates contribute minimally once temporal structure is modeled. 

This contrasts with the LASSO model. Although LASSO selects many of the same variables, its additive linear specification cannot capture nonlinear interactions between lagged pollution levels and meteorological conditions. The performance gap therefore reflects not merely variable inclusion but the ability to model nonlinear temporal dependencies.


### Comparative Interpretation

Overall, the LSTM improved explained variance by approximately 0.10 absolute $R^2$ points relative to the LASSO baseline (roughly a 40% relative increase) while reducing MAE by approximately 11%. Gains over persistence were even larger, confirming that the model captures temporal structure beyond simple autoregressive carry-over effects.

These improvements are statistically meaningful and operationally relevant. The largest gains occur during elevated pollution periods, when nonlinear accumulation, dispersion, and transport mechanisms dominate. Explicitly modeling temporal dependence and nonlinear feature interactions therefore yields consistent and practically significant improvements in next-day PM$_{2.5}$ forecasting accuracy.

The results support the deployment of recurrent architectures in operational air-quality prediction settings where short-term preparedness decisions depend on reliable next-day estimates.



## Regional Heterogeneity, Equity, and Seasonal Strategy

Substantial heterogeneity exists across Ontario regions in both baseline pollution levels and volatility. Southern and industrialized areas—including the City of Toronto, Hamilton, Windsor–Essex, Waterloo Region, and Middlesex County—exhibit persistently higher mean PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations and greater day-to-day variability. These regions combine dense urban activity, major transportation corridors, and industrial emissions, resulting in elevated structural exposure even outside wildfire events. By contrast, many northern districts typically experience lower average concentrations but face heightened vulnerability to episodic long-range wildfire smoke transport. Consequently, some regions function as structural “hotspots,” where both chronic exposure and extreme-event risk are elevated.

These underlying differences help explain variation in predictive performance across regions. Areas with relatively stable, locally driven pollution dynamics—such as major urban centres—tend to exhibit higher $R^2$ values, reflecting stronger persistence and more predictable short-term structure. In contrast, regions prone to abrupt wildfire-driven spikes display lower predictability. Such volatility is often driven by exogenous atmospheric transport rather than gradual local accumulation, making short-horizon forecasting inherently more challenging. Forecast accuracy, therefore, is not solely a function of modeling sophistication but also of environmental stability and exposure to unpredictable shock events.

This geographic heterogeneity has direct equity implications. Proactive forecasting should not be implemented uniformly across the province. Regions with systematically higher baseline exposure and greater volatility warrant prioritized preparedness measures. These may include investment in indoor activity alternatives, portable air filtration where policy permits, and the development of pre-approved communication templates to accelerate response during high-risk days. A differentiated strategy acknowledges that environmental risk is unevenly distributed and supports more equitable allocation of preparedness resources within the education system.

Seasonality further reinforces the need for structured planning. Elevated PM$_{2.5}$ risk is most common during summer wildfire season and, in some regions, during winter inversion periods. A risk-calendar approach allows education authorities to intensify monitoring and preparedness during predictable high-risk windows—particularly June through September—rather than maintaining continuous high-alert states year-round. During summer, when many students are on vacation, schools can still use existing parent–school communication platforms to issue air quality reminders or alerts. This can help families better plan outdoor activities and reduce health risks during high-pollution periods. Aligning communication and preparedness with seasonal risk cycles enhances both efficiency and public health impact.

Importantly, although the LSTM model is nonlinear, its behavior remains consistent with well-established atmospheric mechanisms. Low wind speeds and stable atmospheric conditions reduce dispersion and allow particulate matter to accumulate. Shifts in wind direction can transport wildfire smoke across large distances into otherwise unaffected regions. Precipitation reduces airborne particulate concentrations through wet deposition, while high temperatures during stagnant summer conditions often coincide with elevated pollution episodes. Framing model outputs in terms of these intuitive physical processes strengthens interpretability, builds stakeholder trust, and supports transparent communication with non-technical audiences.


## Operational Value and Responsible Deployment

While statistical accuracy metrics such as MAE and $R^2$ are important, the principal value of forecasting lies in advance notice. A one-day lead time enables schools to schedule indoor programming, adjust physical education and recess plans, prepare ventilation adjustments, and proactively communicate with families. Sensitive student populations, including those with asthma or respiratory conditions, can be notified in advance. Even modest forecast skill can shift institutional posture from reactive to proactive, reducing both health risk and operational disruption.

The operational benefit of preparedness may outweigh incremental improvements in RMSE. From a decision-theoretic perspective, the value of information is asymmetric: avoiding under-preparedness during high-pollution events carries greater benefit than marginal improvements on routine days.

However, responsible deployment requires recognition of system boundaries. Forecast uncertainty increases during abrupt wildfire outbreaks and long-range smoke transport events that may not be fully captured by local meteorological inputs. In such cases, predictions should be interpreted alongside provincial air-quality advisories and other authoritative sources.

We recommend incorporating policy rules that flag days with elevated predictive uncertainty for manual review. Transparent communication regarding model limitations enhances institutional trust and mitigates the risk of overreliance on automated outputs. The system should be positioned explicitly as decision support rather than as a replacement for official environmental alerts.

Overall, the evidence demonstrates that next-day PM$_{2.5}$ forecasting is statistically credible, operationally meaningful, and equity-relevant. Sequence-based models provide measurable improvement beyond persistence, particularly during elevated pollution periods. With responsible implementation and regionally differentiated deployment, predictive analytics can materially enhance preparedness, reduce health risks, and promote equitable resource allocation during air-quality emergencies.

## Executive Takeaways

This analysis shows that next-day PM$_{2.5}$ forecasting in Ontario is both statistically credible and operationally actionable. A sequence-based LSTM model meaningfully outperforms persistence baselines, demonstrating that predictive signal exists beyond simply “copying yesterday.” The improvement is strongest during elevated pollution periods, which are precisely the days where proactive action matters most.

Key implications for decision-makers:

- **Forecasting adds operational value.** A one-day lead time enables proactive scheduling adjustments, communication with families, and preparation for vulnerable student populations.
- **Regional differentiation is essential.** Pollution exposure and predictability vary substantially across regions; deployment should prioritize structurally higher-risk areas.
- **Seasonal strategy improves efficiency.** Preparedness should intensify during predictable high-risk windows (e.g., summer wildfire season) rather than operate in continuous high-alert mode.
- **Decision support, not automation.** The system should augment official advisories and include safeguards for high-uncertainty days.

In summary, implementing a regionally differentiated next-day alert framework is justified on statistical, operational, and equity grounds. With responsible governance and transparent communication, predictive analytics can materially improve preparedness and reduce health risks in Ontario’s education system.
